Controversial “GLOBOCORP” announces the expansion of its entirely automated facility in Eugene, Oregon Tuesday. The new facility would nearly triple the current acreage of its 50 N Danebo Avenue site in west Eugene. The planned construction would move the facilities west boundary, consuming most of the nearby Meadowlark Dry Prairie. A meeting at Eugene’s city hall is scheduled for this Thursday to allow public comment. 
The GLOBOCORP facility in Eugene has spurred local debate since It’s opening last August. GLOBOCORP rose to prominence in the late nineties by offering completely automated manufacturing and distribution of nearly any consumer item. Moderate critics of GLOBOCROP cite the negative affects of automation on the labor market, while more extreme critics hail the international army of robots as an existential threat to modern democracy. 
Little is known about GLOGOCROP’s owner, founder, and sole human employee. While most believe he is most wealthy man in human history, his identity remains unknown. All that is known of his personal life is an unusually strong love for pickles
